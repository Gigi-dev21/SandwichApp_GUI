  <h1>ðŸ¥ª DELI-cious Application</h1>
<p>
  This project is a digital Point of Sale (POS) system for <strong>DELI-cious</strong>, a custom sandwich shop. 
  The goal is to replace the existing paper-based order system with a faster and more efficient computer-based solution.
</p>
 <p>I have developed two versions of the Point of Sale (POS) system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Command-Line Interface (CLI):</strong>
